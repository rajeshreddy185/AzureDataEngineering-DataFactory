**Steps: Use the Set Variable activity**


- Search for the Set Variable activity in the Activities pane and drag it onto your pipeline canvas. 
- Click the Set Variable activity, then go to the Settings tab. 
- In the Variable dropdown, select the variable you created in Step 1. 
- Provide the value you want to assign to the variable in the Value box:
  - Enter a static value: Type a fixed value directly into the box. 
  - Add one more set variable activity to fetch from static variable activity
  - Use dynamic content: Click Add dynamic content to build an expression. This allows you to set the variable based on the output of other activities, system variables, or a combination of functions.
