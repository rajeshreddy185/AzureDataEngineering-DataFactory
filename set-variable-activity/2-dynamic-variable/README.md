SET DYNAMIC VARIABLE ACTIVITY


**Steps: Use the Set Variable activity**
Search for the Set Variable activity in the Activities pane and drag it onto your pipeline canvas.
Click the Set Variable activity, then go to the Settings tab.
In the Variable dropdown, select the variable you created in Step 1.
Provide the value you want to assign to the variable in the Value box. You can:
Enter a static value: Type a fixed value directly into the box.
Use dynamic content: Click Add dynamic content to build an expression. This allows you to set the variable based on the output of other activities, system variables, or a combination of functions.
