## **ITEM NAME FIELD**


- The Item Name field in the Get Metadata activity is used to retrieve the name of the file or folder that your dataset points to.
- Unlike the Child Items field, which gets a list of all objects inside a folder, 
- Item Name is used to get the name of a single, specific object.

Here is how can create the inbound folder to get the child items in the inbound folder with filename.
