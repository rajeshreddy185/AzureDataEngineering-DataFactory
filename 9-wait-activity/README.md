# **Wait Activity in Azure Data Factory**

## Overview
The Wait activity in Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a control flow activity that pauses pipeline execution for a specified 
duration. It's a simple yet much needed tool for managing workflow timing.

## How It Works

### Basic Functionality
- Pause Execution: Halts the pipeline for a defined number of seconds
- No Conditions: Unlike the Until activity, it doesn't evaluate any conditions
- Simple Configuration: Only requires setting the wait duration

### Configuration
- Wait Time: Specify the delay in seconds
- No Additional Settings: No complex parameters or conditions needed

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Process Synchronization
- Usage: Before dependent operations, it Benefit Ensures data completeness.
- Example: Wait for a file to be fully written.

## Best Practices
1. Keep wait times as short as possible while meeting requirements
2. Document the reason for each wait
3. Consider using system variables for dynamic wait times if needed
4. Combine with other activities for complex timing scenarios

## Example Scenario
```plaintext
Start → Wait (30s) → Check File Exists → [If not found, loop back to Wait]
```
